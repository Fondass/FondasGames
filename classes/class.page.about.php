        Good day and welcome on my website.
            <br><br>
            My name is Sybren A.K.A. Fondas on the internet. I have been a gamer all my live (since the very early nineties) and recently (3rd Q of 2015) I became active on the youtubes, recording let’s play videos of different building, fantasy and grand strategy games. I did so taking inspiration from a number of other youtubers. Among others Arumba, Quil18, Trump (the hearthstone player), TotalBiscuit, Fluxtrance, and Sjin (from the Yogscast). Another person is worth mentioning in this list, Lord John, whose dedication to his channel inspired me to start my own.
            <br><br>
            On Dec 1st 2015 The first episode came out for the Axellent gaming show. I teamed up with friend, colleague and all around great guy DandyBanterer to host a podcast centered around gaming. While episodes have come out… inconsistently, I still believe in the potential of this show (or, at the very least, I believe in the fun we have while making it) and thus, shall keep on making these.
            <br><br>
            I am a gamer that believes in the power of games to tell all kinds of cool and interesting stories. From the hands on stories told in Thea the Awakening, to the stories you create yourself in games like Europa Universalis IV. It is there that lies my focus, and I hope to bring that focus to you.
            <br><br>
            Currently I am still making video’s, however the amount has dropped lately (with a gap in between, yeah, sorry for that). This is because the amount of time I have free dropped immensely due to a traineeship in coding that I am following (as might be evident by the existence of this site). This of course will be excellent for my wallet, but a little detrimental toward making more video’s and working on getting this channel rolling.
            <br><br>
            While this means that the amount of video’s coming out will be slow and inconsistent at best, this does not mean I plan on abandoning this channel. Instead, I hope to invest more in my gaming activities in the future with the help of a more stable financial situation.
            <br><br>
            So to all who, for some reason that is beyond my comprehension, still find themselves reading this page: Thank you for your interest in my channel, enjoy my videos, and do not be afraid to comment on a video or two.
            <br><br>
            For I will see you again next time,<br>
            Goodbye.
